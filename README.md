# basicj3otoobj
A basic program I wrote, which gets the geometries from an .j3o file (jMonkeyEngine), and creates individual .obj files for each one in a user directory.

This is the Main.java file for a jMonkeyEngine project.

You must create a folder called 'poop', in your user directory, or modify the location yourself. 

Doesn't work with terrainquads unless you remove the vt section. 

I recommend to get a plugin for wherever you are going to use the .objs to import them all at once, since they all come in seperate files. 

No materials are saved, maybe it'll be added later. idk prob not.
